<h1>Medical Bill Uploader</h1>

A simple React app that allows users to upload medical bills. The application should have the following features:

- A form to input the medical bill information, including the patient name and address, the hospital name, date of service, bill amount and a picture of the bill.

- A summary page that displays the input data, along with a button to return to the form and edit the information.
